<b>Greenpickles987 is an American YouTuber, by Mexican-Dominican descent. He launched a channel on March 26, 2020. He describes himself as a 15-year-old with autism and ADHD. He also describes himself as asexual grayromantic. In his family is a brother, Greenpickleshusky, who is 12 years old and also diagnosed with autism and ADHD. In November 2023, Greenpickles987 got into an online controversy where, among others, YouTubers Chaeify, better known online as Huh Yunnies, and Dat1OrangeCatMan, known online as D1OCM and their followers took part. This conflict started to rise and increase on November 17, when mean comments towards Greenpickles987's videos were made. The comments also accused him of stealing content and called the videos "offensive."
<b>
Everything got worse in early December 2023 when things started to take an even worse turn after a post by Huh Yunnies attracted more hate from her K-pop fanbase and the supporters of Dat1OrangeCatMan. One of these comments referred to him with the offensive slang for special needs and even lied about bullying. This harassment caused immense personal distress, including a family crisis, and resulted in Greenpickles987 losing access to his YouTube channel and the entire platform. The incident reached a point where his channel was deleted by the father of Huh Yunnies, and Greenpickles987's family continues to face challenges due to the situation..
